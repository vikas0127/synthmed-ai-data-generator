## Problem & Solution
Training robust medical AI models requires vast and diverse datasets, but real patient data is often scarce due to privacy regulations and the rarity of certain diseases. SynthMed provides a web interface to generate realistic, customizable chest X-ray images on-demand, accelerating AI research without compromising patient privacy.

## Architecture
This project is a distributed system composed of a local web interface and a remote, GPU-powered AI worker to handle the computationally intensive task of image generation.

## How to Run Locally
1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <your-repo-link>`
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  Run the remote AI worker in the Google Colab notebook provided.
5.  Copy the public `ngrok` URL generated by Colab.
6.  Paste the URL into the `NGROK_URL` variable in `backend/main.py`.
7.  Run the FastAPI backend: `uvicorn backend.main:app`
8.  Run the Streamlit frontend: `streamlit run frontend/app.py`
